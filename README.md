# Chatinator
This is a simple chat service I made.

# For Users
Make sure you jave a JDK, Maven and Java 17 installed
The following steps are executed in a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Doggo101669/Chatinator
cd Chatinator
mvn package
```
After that, Move the .JAR file in the target directory to where you want and run it

# For Developers
1. Contact me at "doggo101669@gmail.com" for me to give you a access token that will only allow you to add to the Repo
2. When adding/commiting/pushing, make sure you do not have a target directory or any build files
